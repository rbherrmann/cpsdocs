    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This tutorial considers wave propagation in water layers from 1.0
      to 5.0km thick in order to assist
      the interpretation of OBS data. The ocean model is based on
      the <a
        href="https://rses.anu.edu.au/seismology/ak135/ak135f.html">AK135-F
        model </a> developed at the Australian National University.
      The model was truncated to consist of just the water layer, crust
      and upper mantle and then converted to the
      MODEL96 format of Computer Programs in Seismology (CPS). The Q<sub>&#954;</sub>
      and Q<sub>&#956;</sub> were converted to
      Q<sub>S</sub> using the relations Q<sup>-1</sup><sub>P</sub> = L Q<sup>-1</sup><sub>&#956;</sub>
      + (1 -L) Q<sup>-1</sup><sub>&#954;</sub>
      and Q<sub>S</sub> = Q<sub>&#956;</sub> where L = (4/3)(V<sub>P</sub> /
      V<sub>S</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
      (Ben-Menahem and Singh, 10.03; Dahlen and Tromp, 9.59 and 9.60).

    should have
    used the average slowness to preserve vertical travel time).

      This is just a test model.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the examples developed below the models will be given with
      names like <i>OCEAN_4.0.mod</i> where the <i>4.0</i>
      indicates that the water layer is 4.0km thick instead of the
      original 3.0km. The examples will
      consider wave propagation with water layer thicknesses of 1.0,
      2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0km.

    <h2>Test scripts</h2>
    <p>Download the script <a href="OCEAN1.tgz">OCEAN1.tgz</a> and
      unpack it using the command
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>gunzip -c OCEAN1.tgz | tar xvf -

</pre>
    <br>
    You will see two directories. OCEAN_SW is for the surface wave study
    and OCEAN_WK is for the generation of a complete seismogram.

      The purpose of this section is to compute the theoretical
      fundamental and first higher mode dispersion for Love and Rayleigh
      waves in each of the models. The computations and results will be
      in the sub-directories with names such as <i>swDIR_5.0</i>.
      The result will be the eigenfunction files <i>slegn96.egn</i> and
      <i>sregn96.egn</i> which are used by the program <b>sdpegn96</b>
      to plot the dispersion. The shell script <b>DOITSW</b> performs
      the computations and creates the plots, which will be a
      superposition of the phase velocity (solid curve) and group
      velocities (dashed curve). The <b>DOITSW</b> assigns a different
      color to each depth from red at 1.0 to blue at 5.0 km.
      The individual plots in each sub-directory are named <i>R.PLT</i>
      and <i>L.PLT</i>. At the top level there are <i>ALLL.PLT</i> and
      <i>ALLR.PLT</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a water thickness of 5.0km, the dispersion plots are shown in
      the next figure.

      This figure demonstrates two things. First all of the Love wave
      plots are the same since the Love wave is not affected by the
      surface water layer. Second the Rayleigh wave dispersion is very
      sensitive to the thickness of the water layer.
    </p>
    <h3>Suggestion</h3>
    <p>
      The model used is generic. It consists of a water layer, a
      sediment layer and a two layer crust. One might perturb the model
      to see the effect of the sediment thickness on the dispersion. It
      seems as if more can be learned about structure from an
      observation of the Love wave than from the Rayleigh wave.
    </p>
    <h2>Complete synthetics</h2>
    <p>
      After completing the surface wave computation, since we will use
      the eigenfunctions later when analyzing the dispersion using <b>do_mft</b>,
      enter the following command in the <i>OCEAN_WK</i> directory.
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>DOITWK
</pre>
    <p></p>
    <p>This script will create a sub-directory for each source depth.
      The computations and results will be in the sub-directories with
      names such as <i>wkDIR_5.0</i>.
      In order to make synthetics that can be used for interpretation of
      ambient noise from OBS seismometers on the sea bottom and, at the
      same time, account for efficient computation, the source is placed
      at a depth of 100m (0.1km) beneath the water-solid boundary and
      the receiver at a depth of 50m (0.05km) beneath the boundary. At
      long periods, this slight shift from a value of 0.0 will not
      affect the synthetics. <b>Note:</b> To obtain the Green's
      functions for a pressure field in the water, the receiver should
      be slightly above the boundary in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The script will compute all Green's functions, but to understand
      the results of ambient noise analysis, the cross-correlation and
      stacking of the Z components (ZZ) will theoretically be the ZVF
      (vertical component observation due to a vertical force) Green's
      function, although the amplitude spectrum will be different. Part
      of this signal will be the Rayleigh wave. If ambient noise is
      obtained from the great circle path radial components (RR), RHF
      (radial due to horizontal force) is the Green's functions to
      consider, and finally THF will be appropriate for the TT
      cross-correlation.
      The purpose of these synthetics is to see what group and phase
      velocities may be obtained from the ambient noise results.
    </p>
    <p>The script <b>DOITWK</b> will compute synthetics at distances of
      100, 200, 300, 400 and 500km. As an example the next figure
      compares
      the ZVF, RHF and THF Green's functions at a distance of 500 km.

        The next figure displays a record section of the THF and ZVF
        Green's functions for a water thickness of 5.0km.

    <h2>do_mft analysis</h2>
    <p>
      A use of the ambient noise empirical Green's functions is to
      determine group and phase velocity. The <b>do_mft</b> applies a
      multiple filter analysis to the seismograms. If shell scripts <b>MFTDOOVERLAY</b>
      and <b>PHVDOOVERLAY</b>
      have been created, then it is possible to overlay the theoretical
      model curves onto the dispersion estimate using the seismogram.
      When working with real data, this feature is used to determine an
      acceptable range of good observations. In this case with
      synthetics, this overlay
      permits one to understand the effects of the model on the
      determination of these velocities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next set of figures are screenshots of a set of <b>do_mft</b>
      windows. Comments will be placed at the bottom of each figure.
      In this example, the water is 5.0km deep, and we consider two
      separate runs - one for the ZVF traces and the other for the THF
      traces. The ZVF will be processed in detail at first, and just the
      important plots for the THF Green's functions will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>To keep the number of figures small, I will just indicate what
      "button" to press on each page. We will start with the ZVF
      synthetics.
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>cd wkDIR_5.0
do_mft -G -IG -T *ZVF
</pre>
    <br>
    For assistance with this command just enter <b>do_mft -h</b>. the
    program is a GUI editor for the work done by the
    programs <b>sacmft96</b> and <b>sacmat96</b>. The <i>-G</i> flag
    indicates that the name of the picked dispersion will have a <i>.dsp</i>
    or <i>.phv</i> appended to the file name for easier identification
    later. The <i>-IG</i> flag tells the program that the waveforms is
    an ambient noise Green's function of the type ZZ, RR or TT, and that
    the phase velocity should account for a &#960;/4 phase shift of the
    source. Finally the <i>-T</i> flag indicates that the program
    should invoke the script <b>MFTDOOVERLAY</b> or <b>PHVDOOVERLAY</b>
    which is in the users PATH. These programs can be hand tailored to
    plot theoretical dispersion onto the observed seismogram dispersion.
    For this example, just the theoretical curves are overlain. I have
    more complicated scripts for North America which overlay theoretical
    curves for selected models and also the results of continental
    tomography.

        At each period, the filtered trace is examined for the maximum
        amplitude of its envelope (used to determine the group velocity
        on Page 4). At this point the instantaneous phase is determined.
        The phase velocity is then computed for multiple values of 2&#960;
        radian phase shifts (this is always an ambiguity in phase
        determination). If is up to the user to select the correct
        branch for the phase velocity.

        Click on "Tomo". this calls the script <b>PHVOOVERLAY</b> which
        plots the theoretical here as red curves.
        We see that it is very difficult to get the phase velocity using
        this technique in this case.

        The result is the picture
        <br>
        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><img src="ZSS_5.png" moz-do-not-send="true" alt="ZVF -
                  Page 5" width="800" height="673"></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we examine the THF Green's function which is related to the TT
      analysis, we obtain the following two figures after entering
      <br>
    </p>
    <pre>do_mft -G -IG -T *THF
</pre>
    and being sure to select "Love" for "Type" on Page 3.
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="THF_4.png" moz-do-not-send="true" alt="THF -
              Page 4" width="800" height="670"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="THF_5.png" moz-do-not-send="true" alt="THF -
              Page 5" width="800" height="657"></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    In this case we actually get some good phase velocities except at
    very long periods.
